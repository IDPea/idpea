## IDPea

IDPea is a resource for information, blog posts and documentation around the topics of identity, authentication, authorization and more. We're a team of contributors from the open source community who work with a lot of different solutions and technologies that are out there, and want to assist others in their journey.

This can be through documentation for features, assisting open-source developers and contributors with complementing documentation, helping those just starting out their journey into self-hosting or programming in general.

## About IDPea

IDPea is a joint initiative by multiple contributors from the open source community, various companies and individuals who are passionate about the topics discussed here. We welcome contributions from others with open arms, and strive to hold an open discussion about most topics relevant to the community.

Whether you're a developer seeking information, someone starting out and wants to request some additional documentation, examples or explanations, or are just looking for a place to scroll around and learn there's a place for you here.
